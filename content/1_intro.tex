\subsection{Kubernetes}

Kubernetes\footnote{\url{https://kubernetes.io/}} is an open-source project for container orchestration. That is well known as K8s, too. This project was started by Google. A Kubernetes cluster has at least one Master node and one Worker node for high availability. This container platform portable for private und public clouds. Kubernetes is available as a managed platform by different cloud providers as same as different Kubernetes distributions exist to download or installations from scratch are possible. It is configurable with different container runtimes, as Docker\footnote{\url{https://www.docker.com/}}, Podman\footnote{\url{https://podman.io/}} or CRI-O\footnote{\url{https://cri-o.io/}} as examples. The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) is necessary for managing container images, the life cycle of container pods, networking and help functions\cite[~p.16]{Scholl2019}.

\section{Mainframe Computers}

Mainframe computers are large computers. Some of them are part of the Z series\footnote{\url{https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/hardware/}} by IBM. They are not only used as internet servers or for banking systems. They can handle large numbers of transactions in one second for e-commerce\cite[~p.56]{Tanenbaum2014}. Such Z systems do not use the well known x86 architecture. They are built with s390x. This architecture has been developed by IBM. It has been introduced in late 2000 and supported by the Linux Kernel since late 1999\cite[~p.15]{Block2019}. The traditional operating system for mainframes has been z\/OS. Linux is used as a base operating system for this Bachelor Thesis.

\section{Hardware Emulation}

Not everybody has access to expensive hardware or hardware with  specific architecture. Software should be able to run on most important hardware architectures. The solution for Software Developers is hardware emulation. You can test based on hypervisors with the hardware emulation whether the software is running correctly.
