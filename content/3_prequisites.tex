\chapter{Method}\label{ch:method}

In this chapter, we're actually using some code!

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,caption={This is an example of inline listing},captionpos=b]
x = 1
if x == 1:
    # indented four spaces
    print("x is 1.")

\end{lstlisting}

You can also include listings from a file directly:

\lstinputlisting[language=Python,caption={This is an example of included listing},captionpos=b]{listings/example.py}
