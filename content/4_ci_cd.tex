\section{CI/CD in the Software Development Lifecycle}

CI/CD is the short name for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery. This method contains systems and technologies used for Test Driven Development. Continuous Delivery provides executing changes in the code, building them to an application and testing it directly. 
If all is working fine, it can be merged. Continuous Delivery is adding automated releases to the process. 
The software is tested automatically by the system before. If all is ok, it can be released.

These tests during the development are integrated into all sprints for agile software development. That has got the name DevOps after adapting these practices with expanding with automated deployments for operations. It is playing an important role through all phases in the software development because of the quality of code today. The code complexity is growing with the size of the project. Therefore, it is beneficially to have automated tests running directly after the commit.
