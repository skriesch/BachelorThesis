\chapter{Outlook}\label{ch:outlook}

This project has been combinining container technologies with an emulator which is used as a foundation for different virtualization technologies. 
Additionally, it has represented a method to deploy applications fast with an emulated system for alternative system architectures.
Emulation bugs fur QEMU have to be fixed. Afterwards, this method can be used in all CI/CD pipelines of open-source projects and on computers by Developers.
New features can be tested without high effort. Following, the software development process can become faster.
There is the possibility to embed the QEMU deployment of Docker images into virtualization technologies as KVM and XEN.
But that requires additional development for alignments. \\
All in all, this emulation method is usable for fast deployments in CI/CD pipelines and system deployments for all system architectures.
