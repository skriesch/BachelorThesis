\chapter{Summary}\label{ch:summary}

This Bachelor Thesis has introduced a new method to deploy applications and emulate the s390x architecture with a combination of the emulator QEMU together with the container technology Docker.
If binfmt-support is enabled on any system, it is possible to use QEMU with qemu-user-static for emulations of multiple system architectures. 
The challenge was, that open-source communities do not support the architecture of IBM Z systems because of missing access for tests. The presented solution can be embedded into the CI/CD infrastructure of open-source projects.
